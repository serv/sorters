        <h2>About Nick Redmark</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nick Redmark, I'm the developer of this platform. I created it mainly for myself, to document my progress as I try to "sort myself out" and "rescue my father from the underworld". Check out more things I do on my <a href="http://nickredmark.com" target="_blank">personal site</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Note for Prof. Peterson:</b> If you happen to end up on this site, I'd like to express my gratitude for what you are doing, and let you know that I'd be delighted to collaborate with you on any project you might have to help people sort themselves out in a more systematic way. In particular I find your project of building an online university for the humanities deeply inspiring.</p>
